CRM for Insurance Companies

InsuraPro Solutions is dedicated to improving the efficiency and quality of customer service for insurance companies by developing an advanced Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system that facilitates the management of customer information and their interactions with the company.

Insurance companies need a systematic and centralized method to manage customer information and track interactions. Many current systems are fragmented or not user-friendly, hindering operational effectiveness and customer satisfaction.   

InsuraPro Solutions will offer an interactive console application developed in C++ that will allow users to manage customer information and their interactions efficiently and intuitively, thus improving customer service and internal management.

Interaction Management: Add, view, and search interactions for each customer (interactions include sales force appointments and signed contracts).
Data Saving and Loading: Save customer and interaction data to a file (text or CSV) and load it at startup.
User Interface: The interface will be command-line based, with a main menu that offers clear options for all necessary operations, ensuring a smooth and accessible user experience.
